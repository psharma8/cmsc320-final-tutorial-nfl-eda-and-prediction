On 13th November 2018, I went to visit my family and friends in Baltimore. My friends and I were talking about NFL.
As most of us are Baltimore Ravens fans, we would love to see Ravens to win superbowl again. However, our team is 
not doing very this season. Some of the friends think that Ravens will be done by end of the regular season and will
not play the any further for these season. In contrast to those friends, there are other friends including me who
think that Ravens still can get to playoff even though they will not be group division champion, Ravens still have
chances to make it through wild card entry.
two or three days later, I decided to predict whether Ravens will actually make it to the playoff or wild card entry
by the end of the month so I can show the result of prediction to my friends and tell them what will more likely to 
happend by the end of the regular season. Addition to showing this result to my friends, I can use is as my project 
demo for one of my Data Science and Machine Learing class. I apply some data science and machine learning technique 
to do this stuff. In order to do it,first I needed to find the data that can be use for my purpose. I've found data 
from github where author has uploaded play by play details of each games from 2009 to presents. the best part of this 
data is they updated every nfl week and are in csv files which is easy to extract the information. All the procedures 
I have done for this are file go_ravens.ipynb, you can walk through the code, prose and  comment to understand the
more in detail. 

I thought I would do this every week after data are updated on source file. Unfortunately, author has stopped updating
any more nfl data after week 11.

Enjoy your day and enjoy Data Science and Machine Learnig :)
