On 13th November 2018, I went to visit my family and friends in Baltimore. My friends and I were talking about the NFL.
As most of us are Baltimore Ravens fans, we would love to see Ravens to win Super Bowl again. However, our team is not doing well this season. Some of the friends think that Ravens will not make it to the playoffs. In contrast to those friends, there are other friends including me, who believe that Ravens still can make to playoff even though they will not be a group division champion, Ravens still have
chances to make it through wild card entry.
Later, I decided to predict whether Ravens will actually make it to the playoff or wild card entry. I apply data science and machine learning technique and skills to do this. First, I needed to find the data that can be useful for my purpose. I found data from GitHub, where the author has uploaded play by play details of each game from 2009 to the present. The best part of this data is they are updated every NFL week and are in CSV files. It is easy to extract the information from the CSV file. All the procedures are in a single file named file go_ravens.ipynb. You can walk through the code, prose and comment to understand them
more in detail. 

I would do this every week, but unfortunately, the author has stopped updating new NFL data after week 11.

Enjoy your day and enjoy Data Science and Machine Learning :)
